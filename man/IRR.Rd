\arguments{
\item{count1}{Incident count for the first sample.}

\item{volume1}{Volume or standardizing value for the first sample.}

\item{count2}{Incident count for the second sample.}

\item{volume}{2 Volume or standardizing value for the second sample.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) and the lower and upper 95% confidence bound.
}
\description{
This simple function calculates the ratio of two incident rates along with a 95% confidence bound for the ratio.
